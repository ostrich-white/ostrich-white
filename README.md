# Ostrich White

Ostrich White is a community-led initiative focused on helping students and early professionals grow through shared experience, guided learning, and practical skill-building.

We’re starting small. A core team, a clear mission, and transparent work from day one. Everything we build is open, simple, and designed to be useful without unnecessary structure.

## What We Do

- Create learning paths based on real experience.
- Run small discussion groups on topics that matter.
- Share practical guides, templates, and resources.
- Support members in developing skills through peer learning.

## Why This Exists

Most people try to learn alone. They waste time on the wrong tutorials, follow unclear career advice, and never get real guidance.  
We’re fixing that by building a community where experience is shared openly, and learning is shaped by real-world needs.

## Current Focus

- Building the community foundation.
- Developing the first version of the **Handbook**.
- Creating a simple framework for members to contribute.

## Repos
